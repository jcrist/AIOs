# AIOs 9/5/14

[Last Week](aio_8_29_14.md)

## Accomplishments

- Formulated estimator equations using FOH on inputs.
- Read first 3 chapters of Boyd CVX
- Finished `ufuncify` PR.
- Met with Brian Taylor to discuss extending PyDy to support Aero applications.
- Laid out skeleton and design for new codegen module.
- Researched, tested, and benchmarked templating engines. Decided new codegen
  module should be engine agnostic.

## Issues

- Took a lot longer for me to reformulate the equations under a first-order
  hold than I expected. I was making the problem harder than it really was.
  Walking away, and coming back to it later helped me see the easy mistake I
  had missed before after staring at it for hours. Brains are dumb sometimes.

- My lab is cold and grey. When it's sunny out I have a hard time working in
  there. Didn't have the will to stay there and get the new hardware working
  :(, worked on simulations instead. Need to prioritize better.

## Objectives

- Finish presentation for PUG on sympy and code generation (due by 9/11/14)
- Layout talk for lab seminar on python for dynamics and controls
- Finish code for new tree elements relevant to code-generation
- Get LVDT working
- Reformulate least squares estimator with nonlinear system form
- Attempt EKF approach with auxilliary system equations
- Write blog post on numpy ufuncs
- Read next 2 chapters of Boyd CVX

## Long Term Objectives

- Solve singularity issue for bicycle example
