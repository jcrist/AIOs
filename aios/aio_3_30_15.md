# AIOs 3/30/15

[Last Week](aio_10_31_14.md)

It's been a busy couple of months; haven't filled one of these out since
10/31/14. There's no way I can cover everything that's happened since then;
this is just for the last week.

## Accomplishments
- Sent in some job applications. More to do still.
- New estimator design, and it works *really* well! Here's a plot:

  ![Sensorless Sensing!!!](https://github.com/jcrist/AIOs/raw/master/images/x_estimate_plot.png)

  This is estimating displacement with no sensors, just measurements of the
  current input to the actuator itself. It's kind of magic. I now have enough
  data and results to start writing my thesis (and a corresponding paper). I'd
  still like to get this working in a closed loop, but the scope of the project
  was just on the estimator design. Getting closer to graduation!

- Pushed a few PRs to [dask](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dask). I stumbled
  across this, read through the issues, and found that the matching stuff I've
  been working on in my spare time solved one of the optimizations issues. It's
  an interesting project, providing a scheduler and data-structures for
  specifying operations on out-of-core datasets. I also read a few papers on
  blocked algorithms for linear algebra, and am excited to try and implement
  some of them in dask. This is another case of open source being more
  interesting than my current school work :/

- Some mentoring stuff for PyDy/SymPy. GSoC applications went in last week, and
  many students had questions on their proposals.

- Read through some of [Murray, Li, Sastry](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/mlswiki/index.php/Main_Page). Very good book
  on the mathematics, dynamics, and control of robotic manipulators.

- Spent some time reimplementing parts of the Corke robotics toolkit in Python
  using SymPy and code-generation. Perhaps this will become part of PyDy.


## Issues
- I hate writing cover letters, so I've been procrastinating on job
  applications. Need to stop doing this, as I'm graduating in 2 months :/
- Spent a long time debugging a 0.2 second lag in the estimator. The issue was
  balancing the gains - with 6 different parameters to tune over a large search
  space, finding the optimal gains that result in smoothing without lag was
  tricky.

## Objectives

- Get [this PR](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dask/pull/110) merged into dask.
  This will allow merging of multiple dasks, eliminating common sub operations.
  This should allow creating several computations lazily, merging them, and
  then computing the result without computing anything twice. Due to the size
  of the datasets dask is intended for, small time overhead for optimization
  passes like this are neglible compared to the gains they can save.
- Start thesis write-up. I want to get the estimator derivation done first, and
  work from there.
- Design poster for PyCon. This will need to be printed early next week, so I
  need to get it done ASAP.
- Finish robotics homework (Due 4/1/15)
- Read chapter 9 of Murray, Li, Sastry.
- Play around with implementing LU decomposition in dask (if time)
