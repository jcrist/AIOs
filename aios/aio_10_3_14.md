# AIOs 10/3/14

[Last Week](aio_9_26_14.md)

## Accomplishments
- Sent in some job applications. More to do still.
- Finished up `Routine` classes for symcc, and add tests and docstrings.
- It lives!!! The estimator can determine position kind of accurately, based
  solely upon (noisy) current measurements. It's also robust-ish to model
  uncertainty. Here's a plot:

- Finished up design of transformation structures. Compilation process (as of
  now) is something like:
    1. Create Routine
    2. Create `SymbolTable` from `Routine`. This will be a dict of every name
    in the code block (function, module, whatever), and the underlying object.
    3. Symbol-tables are stored on corresponding scoped nodes.
    4. Traverse tree. Traversals will have access to current scope
    `SymbolTable`. New symbols should be added here.
    5. Last step before printing is to examine each symbol table, add imports
    and declares for undefined names in that scope (only from known modules
    i.e. math)
- Read 2 chaperts of Boyd CVX. More like skimmed, but I'll count it. We're
  moving on to controls applications, so the rest isn't super important.
- Gave a talk about [PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy) for my lab. It was
  kind of disheartening. I (and others) worked hard on this tool, and the
  response I got was mostly "meh, Matlab and Mathematica can probably do that".
  1.: they can't (readily), 2.: They're not free, and 3.: That's rude.
  Whatever. Slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jcrist/multibody-dynamics-with-sympy-and-pydy),
  demo can be found on github [here](https://github.com/jcrist/talks/tree/master/pydy_talk).

## Issues
- Hardware bugs. Sooooo many hardware bugs. All good now, but in the
  bug-squashing process I fried a board :(

## Objectives

- Try EKF design on hardware, just for fun. Didn't do this. Still want to do
  this. Next week. For sure.
- Tune the estimator some more. Results could definitely be prettier.
- Robustness analysis of algorithm. Need to prove that it *always* converges,
  not just when I'm watching :)
- Lay out design of calibration algorithm for final product.
- Job apps, soooo many job apps. 
- Send in poster session application to PyCon
- Code up `SymbolTable` implementation for SymCC
- Finish up my remaining issues so we can get a release of SymPy out. This is a
  huge priority right now. Haven't been pulling my weight.

## Long Term Objectives

- Solve singularity issue for bicycle example
