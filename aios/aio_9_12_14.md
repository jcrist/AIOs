# AIOs 9/12/14

[Last Week](aio_9_5_14.md)

## Accomplishments
- Got LVDT working and calibrated
- Reformulated least squares estimator to use [lambda1, lambda2, x, R1, R2] as
  state. Still need to simulate and experiment on this form.
- Gave presentation for PUG on sympy and code generation.
- Wrote blog post on new ufuncify and code gen presentation.
- Layout talk for lab seminar on python for dynamics and controls
- Finished code for new tree elements relevant to code-generation
- Redid code printers to use new tree elements
- Got ufuncify PR merged

## Issues
- Somewhere in the transition of rooms during the construction move, all my
  spare parts for the experiment disappeared. Have ordered more, but am stuck
  until they get here.

## Objectives

- Submit PyCon proposal [due 9/15/14]
- Update website to look more professional (Resume, etc...) [due 9/23/14]
- Update Resume [due 9/23/14]
- Read next 3 chapters of Boyd CVX. Didn't have time last week, so I'm falling
  behind. This is a priority now.
- Get driver circuits built and calibrated
- Run robustness tests on new form of least squares estimator
- Get driver micro hooked up to xPC target
- Try least squares simulation using xPC target
- Get symcc testing setup and on Travis
- Write code for new declarative structures

## Long Term Objectives

- Solve singularity issue for bicycle example
