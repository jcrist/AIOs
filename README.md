# AIOs

[Current Week](aios/aio_9_12_14.md)


## What is this

I'm trying a new thing this year to stay productive, and also help me feel like
I'm accomplishing something. The format for each week is as follows:

### Accomplishments

- What did I accomplish this week

### Issues

- What happened this week that prevented me from accomplishing some of last
  week's objectives

### Objectives

- What are my goals for the next week. These should be attainable within the
  next week (nothing long-term)

### Long-term Objectives

- Things I plan on tinkering on in some spare moments for the foreseeable
  future. Too long to do in a single week.

I'll fill one of these out every Friday.
